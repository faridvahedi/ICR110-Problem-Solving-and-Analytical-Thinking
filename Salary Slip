Input: Name
Input: Rate
Input: Hours worked
overtime rate=1.2*Rate
CPP%=4.95%

if Hours worked<40 : it's gonna be normal rate:
Gross income = Hours worked * Rate * (100%-CPP%-EI%)
Net Income = Hours worked * Rate
CPP=Hours worked * Rate *CPP%
EI=Hours worked * Rate *EI%

else : it's gonna include overtime rate: 
Gross income = (40 * Rate + (Hours worked-40)*overtime rate) * (100%-CPP%-EI%)
Net Income = 40 * Rate + (Hours worked-40)*overtime rate
CPP=(40 * Rate + (Hours worked-40)*overtime rate) * CPP%
EI=(40 * Rate + (Hours worked-40)*overtime rate) * EI%
