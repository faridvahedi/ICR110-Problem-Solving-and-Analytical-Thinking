Variable = Number = N  integer number -infinite<N<+infinite
Variable = Divisor = D  D: integer number and 1<D
Variable = Remainder = R R:integer number

Initialize N=0
Initialize D=2

step 1
increasing N + 1

step 2
if N<2  --> it is not a prime number and go back to step 1
else --> take the N for the second step


for N>=2

for i:1:100

if N=2 --> print it as a prime number
else  --> gor for the FOR-LOOP

for 1<D<N
R=N%D
if the R is 0   --> it is not a prime number
else  --> go for the new D=D+1
end

Print i="N is a prime number"
end

end
