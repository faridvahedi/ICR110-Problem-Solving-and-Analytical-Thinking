Variable = Number = N  -infinite<N<+infinite
Variable = Divisor = D  D: integer number and 1<D
Variable = Remainder = R R:integer number


if N<2  --> it is not a prime number
else --> take the N for the second step

for i:1:100

for N>2
for 1<D<N
N%D
Output=R
if the R is 0   --> it is not a prime number
else  --> go for the new D=D+1
end
end

Print N is a prime number
end
